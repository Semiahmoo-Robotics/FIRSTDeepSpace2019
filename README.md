## Contributing

Follow these workflow steps to contribute:

1. Go to the [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/vYKeIKsT/programming) and choose an issue to work on. You may also create a card regarding a specific issue, but it needs to get approval from the CODEOWNERS before taking action. Make sure to add yourself on the card.
2. Make a new branch for your feature. Name it "(Your name)-(Feature)"
3. Implement your feature in the local repository, and commit it to the remote branch.
4. push that branch to the GitHub remote and make a pull request.
5. I will check your changes, then merge your branch with master.

IMPORTANT: No committing to master directly, please. I have set up a branch protection just in case.

Make sure to add yourself on the contributors.md file as well.
